# the-opportunities-in-talk
It is hard to be the best partner, friend, mentor/mentee or colleague when you forget what was said or you miss an action item. These missed opportunities are non-trivial; they can lead to better health, love, trust, happiness, connection and meaning. This repository is a stub for a project that will use AI to address such missed opportunities.
